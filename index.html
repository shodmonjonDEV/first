			<h2>How To Avoid Wasting Your Most Valuable Online Asset - TIME!</h2> 
		</div>
			
			<div class="top">
				If you're involved in an internet marketing business, then
			you've probably already come face-to-face with your #1
			enemy - "Time Wasting".

			What you need to know is that "Time Is Money". And this
			applies even more to the online world, than in regular
			business.

			You see, anyone can become an online entrepreneur. It
			doesn't involve start-up capital or expensive equipment to
			start. A low grade PC and a net connection is all you need.

			And since cash isn't really a barrier, 	time-management has
			become all the more critical. Your challenge for success is
			simply to get more done - in less time.

			<p>So what are the greatest online time wasters and what can you do to avoid them?</p>
			<ol>	
				<li> Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</li>
				<li> Failing to manage your email effectively.</li>
				<li> Getting sucked into pointless forum discussions.</li>
				<li> Failing to set a goal, before you switch the computer on.</li>
   		 	</ol>

			<h4>Retyping the same old thing time and time again.</h4>
		

			This sounds simple. But stop and think how many times you
			retype the same old simple information.

			Most people have cottoned on to automating their email
			signature, but you can go far beyond that when it comes to
			communicating words quickly.

			Get yourself a clickboard or shortcut extender. This will
			enable you to write much faster and prevent you from ever
			having to type the same thing twice.

			I use this utility http://www.howtocorp.com/typepilot , but
			there are lots of other useful typing assistant utilities
			available.

	    	<h4>Failing to manage your email effectively.</h4>
	

			I know, there's so much spam flying around, but you should
			be attempting to win this war with a few weapons of your
			own installed on your computer.

			i. Make sure you have a working piece of anti-spam software
			set up. Whilst sometimes the wrong messages will get
			trapped, the best software will still remove 98% of the
			emails that you don't want. Make sure they are filtered
			into a junk email file, so you can manually sift
			through them afterwards and pull back any that have
			been incorrectly assumed to be unwanted.

			ii. Set up folders in your inbox and get yourself properly
			organized. I keep a folder for SALES, another one for
			FEEDBACK and others for JOINT VENTURES + many more.
